As part of your application to Geotab, we ask that you complete the following challenge.

## Task 1 - Fix some ugly code

Imagine yourself working at Joke Companyâ„¢. This company has an app that gets random Chuck Norris jokes and can substitute other peoples names into the joke instead of Chuck Norris'.

Your task as a professional developer is to clean up this app and make it something you can be proud of.

*Note: This is NOT a representation of our codebase, to be clear. We did have fun crafting this beauty however ;)*

## Task 2 - Write a report

Write a document explaining some of the improvements you made to the code, and why you did so.

## What do I need
